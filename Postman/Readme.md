# Postman

## Generate Token:
This shows how to use Postman to generate a token for use in various applications.

Sometimes you need a token "quick and dirty", for example when you want to access a secured REST endpoint to test a query or check something on the service while developing your app or script. This simple Postman request does just that. Replace username and password with the ones from a user in your organisation to generate a token that you can copy-paste into the url that accesses your service.
